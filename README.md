# My Wish List

An iOS app that allows users to create and share wish lists with their friends.

### How to use the app

####Log in with Facebook:

​	Users can use their existing Facebook account to log into the app.  The user must give the app permissions to view their profile and friends list.

####Add wishes to wish list:

1. **From the app:** On the 'Wishlist' tab, press the '+' button and fill in the desired fields in the 'Add To Wish List!' dialog. (Only 'title' is required). 

   **OR**

2. **From the app extension:** From Safari, the user can navigate to a web page containing the item that they want to add to their wish list and hit the share button, and select the 'Add To My Wishlist' action (The user must enable it the first time).  This action takes the user to the 'Add To Wish List' dialog and auto-populates the 'link' field.

3. After adding a wish, the wish will show up in the user's wish list in the 'Wished' section.  If a user's friend grant's the wish, it will be moved to the 'Granted' section.

####Grant friends' wishes:

1. On the 'Friends' tab, the user can select any user to see a list of their un-granted wishes.

2. Selecting a wish triggers a confirmation dialog, If the user selects 'Yes', the wish will be granted.  (It's assumed that the user will arrange delivery of the item outside of the app).

3. The friend will see that their wish has been granted, but they wont know who granted the wish until they receive the gift.
